DNS Lab Skeleton Files
==============

This repository contains skeleton files for the DNS lab. The following
files are included:

* **named.conf** The main configuration file for named. You
  should edit this file to make changes to your domain, _but do not
  rename or remove the file._
* **db.empty** A skeleton zone file. When you want to
   create a new zone file, make a copy of this file, and edit the copy.
* **db.root** A zone file with all the root servers. This file is
essential for your name server to work correctly. Do not touch it.
* **report.txt** A template for the lab report. Submit your answers
 to the written questions in part 2 by filling in this file. The
 file is in plain text format (UTF-8).
* **README.md** This file (Markdown format).

Lab Submission
==========

You do the lab by cloning this repository. Make your changes by editing
the named config file, adding zone files, and writing answers to the
questions from the lab instructions. Commit your changes to
your local repository, and make sure to push the local repository
to the remote repository on KTH GitHub.

When you are done with the lab, make a submission in the Canvas
assignment for the DNS lab to let the teachers know that you are finished.
